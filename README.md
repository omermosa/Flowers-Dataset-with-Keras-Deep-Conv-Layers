# Flowers-Dataset-with-Keras-Deep-Conv-Layers
This repo implements Deep Conv layers with tensorflow.keras to build a classifier for the flowers image dataset found at: http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz. The dataset contains 5 different categories of flowers. I make use of the pretrained tensorflow MobileNetV2 to improve the accuracy. The model at the end reaches a test accuracy of 86% over 500 images which is higher than the benchmark found at tensorflow website: https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_feature_vector. The trained model can be found with the notebook.
